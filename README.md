# Weak Lensing Cosmological Parameter Regression with Convolutional Neural Network


The GitHub repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the analysis of weak lensing mass maps for cosmological parameter regression. This repository provides a comprehensive framework for utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate cosmological parameters from input mass maps obtained through weak lensing observations.

Key Features:

- Cosmological Parameter Regression: The Jupyter Notebook focuses on performing regression tasks to estimate cosmological parameters from weak lensing mass maps. By leveraging the power of CNNs, the code enables accurate predictions and inference of essential cosmological quantities.
- Input: The input to the notebook is a weak lensing mass map, typically obtained through observations or simulations. 
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The repository employs CNN architectures specifically designed for analyzing mass maps. These networks are trained on labeled datasets containing mass maps and corresponding cosmological parameters, allowing for efficient parameter estimation.
